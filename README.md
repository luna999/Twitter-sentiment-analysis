# Twitter-sentiment-analysis

This project is part of the SemEval-2017 competition Task 4   

https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task4/    

The whole task focuses on sentiment analysis in twitter data and we are particularly interested in the first subtask, which is message polarity classification.   

In this exercise, we would like to classify whether a given Twitter message is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, based on a training dataset with already justified sentiments.   

Three classifiers are built to evaluate the dev set: **Naive Bayes Classifier**, **Maxent Classifier**, and **Logistic Regression Classifier**.   

More details and results can be seen in the "Classifiers.ipynb" notebook.  
"testsets.ipynb" stores commands to input datasets.  
"evaluation.ipynb" are the evaluation functions.
